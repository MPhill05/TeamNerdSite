            <h3>From Minneapolis to Los Angeles</h3>
            <p>My journey into development began in high school and into college, starting with Pascal and later learning my way around Java development. I love being creative and after teaching myself how to produce music, I concluded learning web development shouldn't be too difficult. Curiosity lead me down a totally different path than my original goal of just making a website for my own music.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 id="tech">Technology</h3>
            <p>My goal was to be able to build sites that would leave an impression in a similar way that a good song does. I enjoy challenging myself and building apps that encourage exploration while conveying a clear message.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Web</h3>
            <p>I design sites using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and frameworks such as bootstrap and Angular 2. Recently I have been exploring building hybrid apps using Ionic for faster turn around and the ability to deploy on multiple platforms at once.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 id="app">App Dev</h3>
            <p>Curiosity and creativity didn't stop at web development for me. I wanted to use my back end knowledge obtained in college with Java and decided to learn how to build Android Applications. I've developed various applications, but as I was learning Android development, I wanted to make apps that I could use. So I decided to learn how to make simple apps with xcode as well for iOS. I've built various apps from simple calculators, a tamagachi, and even a functioning social network.</p>
